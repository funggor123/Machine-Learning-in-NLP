# Machine-Learning-in-NLP
Repository for Machine Learning in NLP

This course provides an introduction to statistical machine learning algorithms for natural language processing and using programming tools such as Python (including packages such as NLTK  and Tensorflow) to implement them for real problems. It will use some of the following practical problems such as text classification, information extraction, sequence modeling, text inference, QA system, etc. as illustrations to demonstrate the power of the statistical learning algorithms.

The course is inter-disciplinary that students are required to work in small groups for a number of homework assignments. During the course, there will be some projects requires students working as teams to work on some real-world natural language processing problems. COMP4901K and MATH4824B will encourage students from Math and CSE, CPEG, DSCT, and other departments to register and to work together to bring different background knowledge working on interesting real problems. This will enable students to form multidisciplinary teams.

The course covers the knowledge from both CSE and Math areas:

1) The fundamental machine learning models that deal with real natural language processing problems.
2) The programming and analytic tools such as Python to deal with real natural language processing problems.
3) The problem-solving skill for real natural language processing problems, such as building end to end system to deal with a certain problem.
Some students would have the concern to take courses outside their major areas in terms of their career path. This new CSE course with Math encourages Math students to take the course which indeed covers both areas and broaden their knowledge and the recent development of machine learning and natural language processing. This course will especially server as an introductory course for the DSCT students who would like to work on textual data in their future career. The learning outcomes of the course will be:

Demonstrating machine learning algorithm design skills for NLP tasks;
Analyzing the quality of NLP results to domain problems;
Developing a program that can handle existing real problems.
Course Prerequisites:  Computer science: object-oriented programming and data structures, design and analysis of algorithms; Mathematics: multivariable calculus, linear algebra and matrix analysis, probability and statistics.

Linear Algebra (MATH 2111 or MATH 2121 or 2131), Programming (COMP 2011/2012/2012H), Discrete Math (COMP 2711, 2711H or Math 2343)

Course Topics: Generally, this course will include the topics listed below.  The actual topics covered may evolve somewhat over the semester based on the need to elaborate or focus on specific issues and subtopics. 

Representation: language models, word embeddings;
Learning: supervised learning, sequence models, deep learning, optimization techniques;
Applications: QA, dialog, sentiment analysis, information extraction, etc.
